Used CNN-RNN to recognize the Hindi Handwritten text image with segmentation and convertion to words or characters in digital format. 

<i>In this project, we take on the challenge of classifying the image of any handwritten word, which might be of the form of cursive or block writing. This project combines algorithms that segment the word images in a given line image, which in turn is combined with algorithms that classify the word in a given image of a whole handwritten page. 
It has been a popular research area for many years due to various applications such as digitizing handwritten manuscripts, postal automation, matching documents, digitizing handwritten medical forms. 
This can be extended to the other Indian Handwritten Recognition with accessible Dataset.</i>
